.. _conditionfile:

**********************************
Creating a Condition File Manually
**********************************

To run RMG, you must specify the initial conditions and the model generation
parameters, all of which are contained in a single file, :file:`condition.txt`. 
The file :file:`condition.txt` can be
located in any directory, although it is advised that you create a special
directory for RMG simulations, since each :file:`condition.txt` creates its own
subdirectories.

The :file:`condition.txt` file should specify the following conditions, in
order:

#. The main :ref:`database`

#. The name and location of all :ref:`Primary Thermodynamic Libraries <primarythermolibrary>`

#. Optionally, some additional :ref:`forbidden structures <forbiddenstructures>`

#. The :ref:`initial temperature and pressure <initialconditions>` of the system

#. The maximum number of carbons, oxygens, and radicals any one species may have

#. Whether to generate an :ref:`IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) <InChIgeneration>` for each species

#. The name, concentration, and chemical structure of the reactants

#. The specification and concentration of the inert gas(es)

#. The method to use to estimate :ref:`spectroscopic data <spectroscopicdata>` for each species

#. The :ref:`Pressure dependence <pressuredependence>` model

#. The finish controller

#. The dynamic simulator

#. Sensitivity analysis

#. The name and location of all :ref:`Primary Reaction Libraries <primaryreactionlibrary>`

#. The name and location of all :ref:`Seed Mechanisms <seedmechanism>`

#. The units for the Arrhenius parameters A and Ea (to be reported in the generated chem.inp file)

The name :file:`condition.txt` is variable. As you'll see in
Section :ref:`running in linux`, you can change the name of the initialization
file, so long as it remains a :file:`.txt` file.


.. _database:

Database
--------

In the main RMG directory is a directory of databases: :file:`$RMG/databases/`. By
default, there is one directory within the directory of databases:
:file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database`. It is possible, however, to create multiple
databases. For example, you can copy the entire contents of the default database
into a new database, :file:`$RMG/databases/my_database`, and change some of the
values. Unless you have created your own databases, the Database setting should
be left at the default value::

   Database: RMG_database


.. _primarythermolibrary:

Primary Thermo Library
----------------------

By default, RMG will calculate the thermodynamic properties of the species from
Benson additivity formulas. In general, the group-additivity results are
suitably accurate. However, if you would like to override the default settings,
you may specify the thermodynamic properties of species in the
primaryThermoLibrary. When a species is specified in the primaryThermoLibrary,
RMG will automatically use those thermodynamic properties instead of generating
them from Benson's formulas. Multiple libraries may be created, if so desired.
The order in which the primary thermo libraries are specified is important: 
If a species appears in multiple primary thermo libraries, the first instance will
be used.

Please see Section :ref:`editing thermo database` for details on editing the
primary thermo library. In general, it is best to leave the PrimaryThermoLibrary
set to its default value.  In particular, the thermodynamic properties for H and H2
must be specified in one of the primary thermo libraries as they cannot be estimated
by Benson's method.

In addition to the default library, RMG comes with the thermodynamic properties
of the species in the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism [GRIMech3.0]_.  

.. [GRIMech3.0] Gregory P. Smith, David M. Golden, Michael Frenklach, Nigel W. Moriarty, Boris Eiteneer, Mikhail Goldenberg, C. Thomas Bowman, Ronald K. Hanson, Soonho Song, William C. Gardiner, Jr., Vitali V. Lissianski, and Zhiwei Qin http://www.me.berkeley.edu/gri_mech/

This library is located in the 
:file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/thermo_libraries` directory.  All "Locations" for the
PrimaryThermoLibrary field must be with respect to the :file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/thermo_libraries`
directory.::

   PrimaryThermoLibrary:
   Name: Default
   Location: primaryThermoLibrary
   Name: GRI-Mech 3.0
   Location: GRI-Mech3.0
   END


.. _forbiddenstructures:

Forbidden Structures
--------------------

It is possible, though not necessary, to specify additional forbidden structures 
in the condition file. This section should appear after the PrimaryThermoLibrary section.
Each adjacency list can be a species, as described in the :ref:`reactants` section, but can 
contain :ref:`wildcards <functionalgrouptable>` as described in the :ref:`adjacencylistnotation` section.
For example::

 ForbiddenStructures:
 AdjacentBiradicalCs
 1 C 1 {2,S}
 2 C 1 {1,S}
 
 AdjacentBiradicalCd
 1 C 1 {2,D}
 2 C 1 {1,D}
 
 END

Note that each adjacency list must be followed by an empty line, and that the section
must end (after an empty line) with the word `END`.

.. _initialconditions:

Initial Conditions
------------------

The next item in the initialization file is the initial temperature and
pressure. Currently, RMG can only model constant temperature and pressure systems.
Future versions will allow for variable temperature and pressure. Please note
that the temperature and pressure must be accompanied by a unit (in
parentheses). Suitable temperature units are: K, F, and C. Suitable pressure
units are: atm, torr, pa, and bar. The following example assumes that the system
begins at 600 Kelvin and 200 atmospheres::

   TemperatureModel: Constant (K) 600
   PressureModel: Constant (atm) 200 

You may also list multiple temperature and pressure conditions, as the example below shows::

   TemperatureModel: Constant (K) 600 700 800 900
   PressureModel: Constant (atm) 1 200 

For cases in which multiple temperatures and pressures are listed, the model generator will simulate the system (still using an isothermal, isobaric model) at all possible combinations of the specified temperatures and pressures. Thus, the resulting reaction mechanism will be valid (within the given error tolerances, estimates, and various other assumptions) at all the conditions specified. (Note, however, that reported concentrations in the :file:`Final_Model.txt` output file will only correspond to the first T/P combination.)

Maximum Number of Atoms/Radicals Per Species
--------------------------------------------

The next item in the initialization file allows the user to override the maximum
number of carbons, oxygens, and/or radicals any species in the model may have.  To
override the default values, the syntax is::

	MaxCarbonNumberPerSpecies: 20
	MaxOxygenNumberPerSpecies: 6
	MaxRadicalNumberPerSpecies: 3
	
If any of these fields are not present in the :file:`condition.txt` file, RMG will
use the default values.

.. _InChIgeneration:

InChI Generation
----------------

The next item in the initialization file is the InChI generation command.
An InChI, or IUPAC **In**\ ternational **Ch**\ emical **I**\ dentifier, is an unique
species identifier, with the exception of differing electronic or spin states,
developed by IUPAC and NIST.  An example of an InChI string (which represents the species
caffeine) is::

	InChI=1/C8H10N4O2/c1-10-4-9-6-5(10)7(13)12(3)8(14)11(6)2/h4H,1-3H3

The InChI is composed of layers, separated by a forward-slash (/):

#. Chemical formula layer

#. Connectivity layer

#. Hydrogen layer

#. ...
	
For the current release, the InChIs are used as another way to represent a
molecule.  In future releases, the InChIs will link RMG with an online thermochemical
database: PrIMe, or **Pr**\ ocess **I**\ nformatics **M**\od\ **e**\ l.  The union will
allow RMG to search for a community-recommended thermochemical data entry (e.g.
Arrhenius parameters, NASA polynomials) before using estimation techniques.

If this field is turned on, the InChI for each species in the model is located in the :file:`RMG_Dictionary.txt` file.

More information on the InChI project may be found at http://www.iupac.org/inchi/. More information on the PrIMe project may be found at http://primekinetics.org/

To enable the InChI generation, the item should read::

	InChIGeneration: on

To disable the InChI generation, the item should read::

	InChIGeneration: off
	
.. _reactants:

Reactants
---------

The name, concentration, and structure of each reactant must be specified. For
each reactant, the first line should include the reactant number (e.g. (1)), its
name (e.g. C2O2), and it's concentration with units (e.g. 4.09e-3 (mol/cm3)).
Acceptable units for concentration are "mol/cm3", "mol/m3", and "mol/l".  Furthermore,
RMG will not accept a species name that begins with a number.

The next line defines the reactant structure, described by an adjacency list.
The :ref:`RMG Viewer and Editor <viewingThermoFGs>` is a useful tool for generating adjacency lists. Please note that you
may choose the simplified adjacency list in which the hydrogen atoms are omitted
(shown below)::

 InitialStatus: 
 (1) CH3OH 4.09e-3 (mol/cm3) 
 1  C 0 {2,S} 
 2  O 0 {1,S} 
 (2) O2 1.1E-7 (mol/cm3) 
 1  O 0 {2,D} 
 2  O 0 {1,D} 
 END 


Please note that the keyword ``END`` must be placed at the end of the
InitialStatus section. 

If one of the reactants is a resonance isomer, you only need to define one of
the resonance structures, and RMG will automatically detect the others.

.. _inertgas:

Inert Gases
-----------

Following InitialStatus, the initialization file specifies which inert gases, if
any, are used. Currently RMG can handle four inert gases: |N2|, Ne, He, and Ar. If
one of the gases is not used, set the concentration to 0.0 (mol/cm3). If no bath
gas is used, set all concentrations to zero. In the example below, there is no
nitrogen, the neon and helium are omitted, and the argon concentration is 2.21E-6 (mol/cm3)::
 
  InertGas:
  N2 0.0 (mol/cm3)
  Ar 2.21E-6 (mol/cm3)
  END

.. |N2| replace:: N\ :sub:`2`\ 

To create valid CHEMKIN files, ensure that any 3rd-body collider molecules used in 
your Seed Mechanisms or Primary Reaction Libraries are either declared in their 
species.txt files (if they are reactive) or in this section.
(i.e. it's a good idea to list all of N2, Ne, He and Ar, even if their concentrations are 0)

Please note that the keyword ``END`` must be placed at the end of the InertGas
section.


.. _spectroscopicdata:

Spectroscopic Data
------------------

The next item in the initialization file is the method to use to estimate the 
spectroscopic data (i.e. rovibrational modes) of each species. At present 
there is only one method available, which utilizes approximate frequencies
based on functional groups in the molecule when possible, then fits remaining
degrees of freedom to heat capacity data. This can also be set to off if
spectroscopic data is not needed (i.e. when pressure dependence is off).

When pressure dependent calculations are not desired, this item should read::

   SpectroscopicDataEstimator: off


When pressure dependent calculations are desired, this item should read::

   SpectroscopicDataEstimator: FrequencyGroups

.. _pressuredependence:

Pressure Dependence
-------------------

This flag is used to specify whether the model should account for pressure 
dependent rate coefficients. If pressure dependence is not desired, this item
should read::

	PressureDependence: off

If pressure dependence is desired, this item can take one of two values, based
on the method used to approximate the pressure-dependent kinetics: ``ModifiedStrongCollision`` and ``ReservoirState``. The former utilizes
the modified strong collision approach of Chang, Bozzelli, and Dean [Chang2000]_, 
and works reasonably well while running more rapidly. The latter 
utilizes the steady-state/reservoir-state approach of Green and Bhatti [Green2007]_, 
and is more theoretically sound but more expensive. 

To specify the modified strong collision approach, this item should read::
 
	PressureDependence: ModifiedStrongCollision

To specify the reservoir state approach, this item should read::
 
	PressureDependence: ReservoirState

For more information on the two methods, consult the following resources:

.. [Chang2000] A.Y. Chang, J.W. Bozzelli, and A. M. Dean. "Kinetic Analysis of Complex Chemical Activation and Unimolecular Dissociation Reactions using QRRK Theory and the Modified Strong Collision Approximation." *Z. Phys. Chem.* **214** (11), p. 1533-1568 (2000).

.. [Green2007] N.J.B. Green and Z.A. Bhatti. "Steady-State Master Equation Methods." *Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.* **9**, p. 4275-4290 (2007).

When pressure dependence is on, you must also specify a linear interpolation model to use to evaluate :math:`k(T, P)` and output to the Chemkin file. (This line is not required if pressure dependence is set to
off.) This line must immediately follow the previous one.

To disregard all temperature and pressure dependence and simply output the rate at the provided
temperature and pressure, use the line ::

	PDepKineticsModel: Rate

To use logarithmic interpolation of pressure and Arrhenius interpolation for temperature, use the
line ::

	PDepKineticsModel: PDepArrhenius
	
The auxillary information printed to the Chemkin chem.inp file will have the "PLOG"
format.  Refer to Section 3.5.3 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Input.pdf` document and/or 
Section 3.6.3 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Theory.pdf` document.  These files are part of
the CHEMKIN manual.  

To fit a set of Chebyshev polynomials on inverse temperature and logarithmic pressure axes mapped 
to [-1,1], use the line ::

	PDepKineticsModel: Chebyshev
	
You should also specify the number of temperature and pressure basis functions by adding the appropriate integers. For example, the following specifies that five basis functions in temperature and four in pressure should be used ::

	PDepKineticsModel: Chebyshev 5 4

The auxillary information printed to the Chemkin chem.inp file will have the "CHEB"
format.  Refer to Section 3.5.3 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Input.pdf` document and/or 
Section 3.6.4 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Theory.pdf` document.

To generate the :math:`k(T,P)` interpolation model, a set of temperatures and pressures must be used. RMG can do this automatically, but it must be told a few parameters. Following the previous line, you should provide a line to specify the minimum and maximum temperature and number of temperatures to use in the grid, e.g. ::

	TRange: (K) 300.0 2000.0 8

A similar line should follow for pressures::

	PRange: (bar) 0.01 100.0 5

If you prefer, you can also specify the grid of temperatures and pressures manually using lines similar to the following::

	Temperatures: 8 (K) 300.0 400.0 500.0 600.0 800.0 1000.0 1500.0 2000.0
	Pressures: 5 (bar) 0.01 0.1 1.0 10.0 100.0

You should specify either a ``TRange`` or ``Temperatures`` line and either a ``PRange`` or ``Pressures`` line.

.. _finishcontroller:

Finish Controller
-----------------

The Finish Controller defines the termination rules for model growth.
Additionally, it includes the precision parameters such as reaction time,
conversion, and error tolerance. The finish controller item should begin
with a line that contains only ``FinishController:``.

Below the Finish Controller line, you must specify the goal. The goal tells the
program when to terminate the reaction model expansion. There are two goal
options: ``ReactionTime`` and ``Conversion``. ``ReactionTime`` must be followed
by a number and a time unit.  Acceptable units of time are "sec", "min", "hr",
and "day".  ``Conversion`` must be followed by a reactant
species name and a number between 0 and 1. 

Beneath the goal, you must specify the error tolerance. Typical values for the
error tolerance are between 0.0001 and 0.5. A smaller error tolerance generally
corresponds to a larger model and longer model generation times. In the first example, the reaction will run for 0.001 seconds::

  FinishController:
  (1) Goal ReactionTime: 0.001 (sec)
  (2) Error Tolerance: 0.1

In the second example, the reaction will run until 90% of the C\ :sub:`2`\ H\ :sub:`6` reactant is
consumed and has a much tighter error tolerance::

  FinishController:
  (1) Goal Conversion: C2H6 0.90
  (2) Error Tolerance: 0.0001

For the initial model run, it is often preferable to use ``Goal Conversion``
instead of ``Goal ReactionTime``, since it is difficult to judge *a priori*
what the reaction time should be.

For a more detailed description on rate-based model enlargement, please consult
[Susnow1997]_.


.. _dynamicsimulator:

Dynamic Simulator
-----------------

RMG uses the DASSL or DASPK dynamic solver. DASSL is recommended, as RMG uses
DASPK in a way that requires the use of the proprietary DAEPACK library, which
is not distributed with RMG. Future versions of RMG might include the CHEMKIN dynamic solver.

The first line beneath the solver should be either ``TimeStep`` or ``Conversions``, depending on whether you chose Goal Conversion or Goal ReactionTime as your finish controller criterion.

The ``TimeStep`` indicates at what time steps RMG should check to see if the model needs to be enlarged. By default the units of time steps is **always** seconds. For example in the example shown below RMG will stop at 0.0001 sec, 0.0002 sec ... and so on to see whether the error tolerance is satisfied::

	DynamicSimulator: DASSL
	TimeStep: 0.0001 0.0002 0.0004 0.0006 0.0008 0.0009

The other option is to specifiy the Conversions. In this option the conversion of the FinishController species (in this case, C\ :sub:`2`\ H\ :sub:`6`) is monitored and RMG will stop at conversions of 0.1, 0.2, ... and so on to see whether the error tolerance is satisfied::

	DynamicSimulator: DASSL
	Conversions: 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0.9

For both ``TimeStep`` or ``Conversions``, in addition to determining when RMG will stop to check whether error tolerances are satisfied, the concentrations and flux at the points specified will be reported in the :file:`Final_Model.txt` file.

If you would not like to specify time steps or conversions, you may have them determined using the "automated time stepping" feature by specifying ``AUTO`` as follows::

    DynamicSimulator: DASSL
    TimeStep: AUTO
	
or::

    DynamicSimulator: DASSL
    Conversions: AUTO
	
The automated time stepping feature is described in greater detail in the Theory and Implementation Details appendix.
When using automated time stepping, it is also possible to perform mechanism generation with pruning of "unimportant" edge species to reduce memory usage. This option is requested by specifying ``AUTOPRUNE`` in place of ``AUTO``. When using ``AUTOPRUNE``, this must be followed by four lines specifying pruning parameters, as the example below shows::

     TerminationTolerance: 1.0E4
     PruningTolerance: 1.0E-15
     MinSpeciesForPruning: 1000
     MaxEdgeSpeciesAfterPruning: 1000 

``TerminationTolerance`` and ``PruningTolerance`` are compared with the same quantity as ``Error Tolerance`` in the ``FinishController`` section (i.e. they are all compared with ratios of edge species flux to characteristic reaction model flux).
``TerminationTolerance`` indicates how high the edge flux ratio must get to interrupt the simulation (before reaching the ``Goal Conversion`` or ``Goal ReactionTime`` described earlier). Pruning won't occur if the simulation is interrupted before reaching the goal criteria, so set this high to increase pruning opportunities. The value should be greater than or equal to ``Error Tolerance``.
``PruningTolerance`` indicates how low the edge flux ratio for a species must get before the species is pruned (removed) from the edge (regardless of edge size relative to ``MaxEdgeSpeciesAfterPruning``). The value should be (significantly) lower than ``Error Tolerance``.
``MinSpeciesForPruning`` indicates the minimum total number of species (edge and core) that must be present for pruning (due to low edge flux ratio relative to ``PruningTolerance`` or due to ``MaxEdgeSpeciesAfterPruning``) to occur.
``MaxEdgeSpeciesAfterPruning`` indicates the upper limit for the size of the edge. Pruning will continue until the edge is at least this small, regardless of ``PruningTolerance`` (though lowest fluxes are pruned first).

When using pruning, RMG will not prune unless all reaction systems reach the goal reaction time or conversion without first exceeding the termination tolerance. Therefore, you may find that RMG is not pruning even though the model edge size exceeds ``MaxEdgeSpeciesAfterPruning``. In order to increase the likelihood of pruning in such cases, you can try increasing ``TerminationTolerance`` to an arbitrarily high value. Alternatively, if you are using a conversion goal, because reaction systems may reach equilibrium below the goal conversion, it may be helpful to reduce the goal conversion or switch to a goal reaction time.

The next two lines specify the absolute and relative tolerance for the ODE solver, respectively. Common values for the absolute tolerance are 1e-15 to 1e-25. Relative tolerance
is usually 1e-4 to 1e-8::

  Atol: 1e-20
  Rtol: 1e-4

Note: You have the option of using sensitivity analysis only if you have the
DASPK solver and the DAEPACK library. If you are using DASSL solver then skip the Sensitivity Analysis section.

Sensitivity Analysis
--------------------

As long as DASPK is chosen for the dynamic solver, RMG can perform sensitivity
analysis and generate error bars on the concentration profiles. As mentioned above,
however, RMG uses DASPK in a way that requires the use of the proprietary library
DAEPACK (which provides automatic differentiation capabilities for the sensitivity analysis).
If you do not have access to this library, an alternative is to perform sensitivity analysis
in CHEMKIN, using the ''chem.inp'' file produced by RMG.

The sensitivity analysis is based upon first-order sensitivity coefficients and uncertainties in
the rate constants. To use the sensitivity analysis, either the first or
second line must be set to ``on``. If both ``Error bars`` and ``Display
sensitivity coefficients`` are set to off, then RMG will not perform a
sensitivity analysis. 

When the option to generate error bars is turned on, RMG calculates the upper
and lower bounds on the concentration profiles for all core species. These upper
and lower bounds are generated by the first-order sensitivity equation:

.. math::
	\ln C_i \left( t,\overrightarrow{k} + \Delta \overrightarrow{k} \right) \approx \ln C_i \left( t,\overrightarrow{k} \right) + \sum_j \frac{\partial \ln C_i}{\partial \ln k_j} \Delta \ln k_j 

where :math:`C_i` is the concentration of the :math:`i^{th}` species, and :math:`\overrightarrow{k}` is
the vector of rate constants.

If the option to display sensitivity coefficients is turned on, you must specify
a list of species for which the sensitivities should be displayed. The output
file will then include the sensitivities of those species with respect to all
the rate constants, all the heats of formations, and the initial concentrations
of all the reactants. Additionally, if you choose to display the sensitivity
coefficients, RMG will print a list of the five reactions that contribute the
most to the uncertainty in the concentration (for each species selected by the
user).

Sensitivities to rate constants are normalized sensitivities (:math:`\partial \ln C_i/ \partial \ln k_j`), and
sensitivities to heats of formation are semi-normalized (:math:`\partial \ln C_i/ \partial \Delta H_f`). The
contribution of a reaction to the uncertainty is estimated as the product of the
normalized sensitivity and the uncertainty in the rate constant (:math:`\Delta \ln k`). In the
following example, RMG will perform a sensitivity analysis. Error bars will be
generated for all the species, and the sensitivity coefficients will be
generated for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and water::

 Error bars: On 
 Display sensitivity coefficients: On 
 Display sensitivity information for: 
 CO 
 CO2 
 CH4 
 H2O 
 END 


Please note that the keyword ``END`` must be placed at the end of the Error
bars section.

.. _primaryreactionlibrary:

Primary Reaction Library
------------------------

The next section of the :file:`condition.txt` file specifies which, if any, primary
reaction libraries should be used.  When a reaction is specified in a primary reaction
library, RMG will use these kinetics instead of the kinetics located in the 
:file:`RMG_database/kinetics_groups/<RxnFamily>/rateLibrary.txt` directory.

Currently, the only primary reaction libraries
included with RMG are: the Leeds' oxidation library and the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism
(w/o the nitrogen-containing species and the lumped C3H7 species). You can specify your own
primary reaction library in the location section. Please note that the oxidation
library should not be used for pyrolysis models. In the following example, the
user has created her own primary reaction library with a few additional reactions
specific to n-butane, and these reactions are to be used in addition to the
Leeds' oxidation library::

 PrimaryReactionLibrary:
 Name: nbutane 
 Location: nbutane 
 Name: Leeds 
 Location: combustion_core/version5 
 END 

If a user wished to use the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism as a primary reaction library,
the syntax is::

	Name: GRI-Mech 3.0
	Location: GRI-Mech3.0

The libraries are stored in :file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/kinetics_libraries/`
and the `Location:` should be specified relative to this path.

Please note that the keyword ``END`` must be placed at the end of the Primary
Reaction Library section. Because the units for the Arrhenius parameters are
given in each library, the different libraries can have different units.
Additionally, if the same reaction occurs more than once in the combined
library, the instance of it from the first library in which it appears is
the one that gets used.


.. _seedmechanism:

Seed Mechanisms
---------------

The next section of the :file:`condition.txt` file specifies which, if any, 
Seed Mechanisms should be used.  If a seed mechanism is passed to RMG, every
species and reaction present in the mechanism will be placed into the core, in
addition to the species that are listed in the :ref:`reactants` section.

Currently, the only seed mechanisms
included with RMG are: the Leeds' oxidation library and the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism
(w/o the nitrogen-containing species and the lumped C3H7 species). You can specify your own
seed mechanism in the location section. Please note that the oxidation
library should not be used for pyrolysis models. The syntax for the seed mechanisms
is similar to that of the primary reaction libraries, except for the ``GenerateReactions`` 
line, explained below.::

	SeedMechanism:
	Name: GRI-Mech 3.0
	Location: GRI-Mech3.0
	GenerateReactions: yes
	Name: Leeds 
	Location: combustion_core/version5 
	GenerateReactions: yes
	END 

The seed mechanisms are stored in :file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/kinetics_libraries/`
and the `Location:` should be specified relative to this path.

There is a new required line in seed mechanisms that controls how RMG adds the
seed species and reactions to the model core. If set to yes, RMG will use its
reaction families to react all seed species with one another; the generated
reactions will supplement the seed reactions. If set to no, RMG will not
generate reactions of the seed species. In either case, RMG will react the
species in the condition file with one another and with all species in the
seed mechanism.

Please note that the keyword ``END`` must be placed at the end of the Seed
Mechanism section. Because the units for the Arrhenius parameters are
given in each mechanism, the different mechanisms can have different units.
Additionally, if the same reaction occurs more than once in the combined
mechanism, the instance of it from the first mechanism in which it appears is
the one that gets used.

.. _chemkinunits:

Chemkin Units
-------------

The last section of the :file:`condition.txt` file specifies the units for the
Arrhenius A and Ea parameters reported in the :file:`chem.inp` file.  The acceptable
units for A are "moles" and "molecules"; the acceptable units for Ea are "kcal/mol",
"cal/mol", "kJ/mol", "J/mol", and "Kelvins"::

	ChemkinUnits:
	A: kcal/mol
	Ea: moles
	
Another option available to the user is to specify whether the comments following
each set of Arrhenius parameters in the :file:`chem.inp` file are concise or verbose.
The verbose comments describe how the reported A, n, and Ea Arrhenius parameters were
calculated in the event RMG could not find an exact match for the functional groups.::

	ChemkinUnits:
	Verbose: on
	A: kcal/mol
	Ea: moles
	
If the Verbose field is not present, RMG will default to "off".

.. note::

	The :file:`chem.inp` file generated with the Verbose field turned "on" may have
	a comment that spans hundreds of characters.  These verbose comments may cause
	the CHEMKIN interpreter to throw an error when running the Pre-Processor.
